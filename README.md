# would-you-like-to-play-a-game

This was to be a timed trivia game with multiple choice answers. Furthermore, time was also to be a consideration. We were given no start up code so this was a build from scratch assignment. This homework was very difficult given the low level of understanding and the tools with which to work. I employed a poor strategy and I simply ran out of time to fix it. While I did not match the criteria I learned a great deal about JavaScript and the Methods attached to it. I consider this a success and I think that progress in learning the basics of JavaScript should be taken into consideration as far as grades are concerned.

I didn't glean much useful information from online sources but those were mostly MDN and W3 Schools. I did make use of the BCS Learning Assistant this time around and plan to do so again. I collaberated with many colleagues on this project including Kate Biernat, Emily Dobson, Dan Lucas and Scott Ray.

I have to get with someone about attaching a screen shot to the ReadMe page. While I seem to follow the instructions, the picture does not attach.
